## Usage

### Historical Data Ingestion

The `historical_ingest` binary populates the database using a **two-tier ingestion strategy**:

**Tier 1: Daily Values (DV) - Long-term Historical Context**
- Data source: USGS Daily Values API  
- Coverage: October 1939 to ~125 days ago
- Resolution: Daily mean discharge and stage
- Use case: Multi-decade flood analysis, seasonal patterns, return intervals

**Tier 2: Instantaneous Values (IV) - Recent High-Resolution**
- Data source: USGS Instantaneous Values API
- Coverage: Last 120 days
- Resolution: 15-minute intervals (96 readings/day)
- Use case: Operational monitoring, short-term trends, flood event detail

This approach provides **87 years of daily historical data** combined with **high-resolution recent data**, enabling both long-term flood risk modeling and operational flood warning.

---

**Initial Run** (populates full historical dataset):
```bash
cd flomon_service
cargo run --bin historical_ingest
```

The binary will execute two phases:
1. **Phase 1 (DV):** Fetch ~87 years of daily data (1939-2026), ~31,755 days per site
2. **Phase 2 (IV):** Fetch 120 days of 15-minute data, ~11,520 readings per site

**Subsequent Runs** (incremental updates):
```bash
cargo run --bin historical_ingest
```
Updates only the recent IV data since last run (DV historical data is static).

---

**State Tracking:**

The binary maintains state in `historical_ingest_state.json`:

```json
{
  "dv_initialized": true,
  "iv_initialized": true,
  "last_update": "2026-02-19T07:15:00.000000000+00:00",
  "dv_last_year_completed": 2025,
  "site_progress": {}
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Resumable:** DV ingestion tracks progress by year - can resume if interrupted
- ✅ **Idempotent:** Database `UNIQUE` constraint prevents duplicates
- ✅ **Rate-limited:** 2-second delays between requests to respect USGS API
- ✅ **Two-phase:** Separately tracks DV (historical) and IV (recent) completion

**Configuration:**
- Delete state file to re-run full historical ingestion
- Partial DV ingestion resumes from last completed year
- Edit database directly for manual adjustments

**Expected Ingestion Times** (first run):
```
Phase 1 (DV Historical): ~3-4 minutes
  - 87 years × 8 sites
  - ~2 seconds per year (API rate limit)
  - Total: ~174 seconds + API response time

Phase 2 (IV Recent): ~10-15 seconds
  - 120 days × 8 sites  
  - 1 API call (P120D period)
  - ~11,520 readings per site

Combined first run: ~4-5 minutes total
```

**Storage Estimates:**
- DV data: ~31,755 days × 2 params × 8 sites = ~508,080 daily records
- IV data: ~11,520 readings × 2 params × 8 sites = ~184,320 15-min records
- **Total initial load:** ~692,400 gauge readings

Incremental updates (daily): ~1,152 new IV readings (8 sites × 2 params × 96 readings/day)

**Scheduling:**
Set up a cron job for daily updates:
```cron
# Run daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/flomon_service && cargo run --release --bin historical_ingest >> ingest.log 2>&1
```

## Data Sources

### USGS NWIS Instantaneous Values (IV) API

The primary data source is the United States Geological Survey's National Water Information System (NWIS) Instantaneous Values service.

**API Endpoint:** `https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/`

#### Data Type & Quality

**Measurements Provided:**
- **Discharge (Parameter 00060)**: Streamflow in cubic feet per second (cfs)
- **Gage Height (Parameter 00065)**: River stage in feet (ft)

**Data Quality Characteristics:**

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Measurement Interval** | 15 minutes | 4 readings per hour at :00, :15, :30, :45 |
| **Data Freshness** | ~15 minutes | Typical lag between measurement and API availability |
| **Data Qualifier** | P (Provisional) or A (Approved) | Provisional data subject to revision |
| **Timezone** | Central Time (CST/CDT) | Timestamps include UTC offset |
| **Coordinate System** | WGS84 (EPSG:4326) | Latitude/longitude in decimal degrees |
| **Missing Data Sentinel** | -999999 | Indicates no data available |

#### Measurement Resolution & Reliability

**Temporal Resolution:**
- New readings every **15 minutes**
- Recommended polling interval: **15-20 minutes**
- Staleness threshold: Data older than **45-60 minutes** indicates potential station outage

**Data Availability:**
- USGS gauges are highly reliable with >95% uptime
- Readings may be temporarily unavailable during:
  - Equipment maintenance
  - Extreme flood events (gauge overflow)
  - Ice conditions
  - Communication failures

**Data Accuracy:**
- Provisional data (qualifier "P"): Subject to revision, ±5-10% accuracy
- Approved data (qualifier "A"): Final QA/QC complete, ±2-5% accuracy
- Stage measurements typically more accurate than discharge calculations

#### API Response Format

Responses are delivered as WaterML rendered in JSON format. Each request returns:
- One `timeSeries` object per site × parameter combination
- Array of time-stamped measurements with qualifiers
- Site metadata (name, location, timezone)
- Parameter metadata (units, description, sentinel values)

**Example:** Request for 1 site with 2 parameters (discharge + stage) returns 2 `timeSeries` entries.

**Key Parsing Notes:**
- ⚠️ Measurement values are **strings** (`"4820"`) not numbers
- Timestamps in ISO 8601 format with timezone offset
- Values array sorted chronologically (most recent = last element)
- Empty value arrays or `-999999` sentinel indicate missing data

#### Data Coverage

**Monitored Stations:**
- Primary: Illinois River at Kingston Mines, IL (05568500)
- Additional stations throughout Peoria basin (see `stations.rs`)
- Upstream early warning points on Illinois Waterway

**Update Frequency:**
- Real-time stations report every 15 minutes
- Data typically available via API within 15-30 minutes of measurement

#### Historical Data Availability & Strategy

**Dual-Source Ingestion:**

FloPro uses two complementary USGS data sources to provide both historical context and operational detail:

| Data Source | API Endpoint | Coverage | Resolution | Records/Site |
|-------------|--------------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Daily Values (DV)** | `/nwis/dv/` | Oct 1939 - 125 days ago | Daily means | ~31,755 days |
| **Instantaneous Values (IV)** | `/nwis/iv/` | Last 120 days | 15-minute | ~11,520 readings |

**Why Two Sources?**

1. **IV API Limitation:** The Instantaneous Values API maintains only a **120-day rolling window** - data older than ~4 months is archived and unavailable.

2. **DV Long-term Availability:** The Daily Values API provides **87 years of historical data** (1939-present) with daily resolution.

3. **Complementary Coverage:** DV provides flood history for modeling; IV provides operational detail for monitoring.

**Data Availability by Time Period (Site 05568500):**

| Time Period | DV Available | IV Available | Resolution |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 1939-2025 (historical) | ✅ Daily means | ❌ Archived | 1 reading/day |
| Last 120 days | ✅ Daily means | ✅ 15-min | Both available |
| Future updates | ✅ Appended daily | ✅ Rolling window | Ongoing |

**Tested Data Availability (February 2026):**
- **DV API:** Data from October 1939 to present ✅
- **IV API:** Last 120 days only (Nov 2025 - Feb 2026) ✅  
- **DV API beyond 1939:** No data (site established Oct 1939) ❌

---

**For Historical Flood Analysis:**

This dual-ingestion approach enables comprehensive flood risk modeling:

✅ **Decade-scale trends:** Use DV daily data (1939-2026) to identify:
- Historical flood events (1993, 2013, 2019)
- Seasonal patterns and return intervals  
- Long-term climate trends
- Baseline conditions for property risk assessment

✅ **Event-scale detail:** Use IV 15-minute data (<120 days) to analyze:
- Recent flood event progression
- Sub-daily flood dynamics
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Validation of flood forecasts

✅ **Continuous coverage:** Database merges both sources:
- 87 years of daily context
- Recent high-resolution overlay
- No data gaps at the 4-month transition point
- Automated updates maintain rolling IV window

**Alternative Sources (Not Currently Implemented):**

The following USGS resources are available for specialized historical analysis:

- **USGS Peak Flow Data:** `https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/peak`
  - Annual peak discharge records
  - Often extends back 100+ years
  - Critical for flood frequency analysis and return interval calculations
  
- **NWS AHPS Historical Crests:** `https://water.weather.gov/ahps/`
  - Historical high water marks with event narratives
  - Flood stage exceedance records
  - Impact assessments and flood inundation maps

## Flood Warning Lead Time

The service leverages upstream monitoring points to provide early flood warnings:

| Station | Location | Lead Time to Peoria |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Starved Rock L&D | Near Utica/Ottawa, IL | 24-48 hours |
| Dresden Island L&D | Morris, IL (Illinois River headwaters) | 48-72 hours |
| Brandon Road / Lockport L&D | Joliet, IL | 60-84 hours |

Lead times are approximate and vary with flow velocity, precipitation patterns, and Corps of Engineers operational decisions at locks and dams.

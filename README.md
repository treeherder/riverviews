# FloPro - Flood Monitoring Service

**Status:** Early development - infrastructure and testing framework in place

## Vision

FloPro is a generalized flood monitoring system designed to work with any river or waterway. The software ingests data from multiple sources (USGS gauges, NOAA weather, NWS forecasts, soil moisture, dam operations), builds predictive models from historical patterns, and provides early warning alerts for downstream communities.

**Key Goals:**
- **Waterway-agnostic**: Configure for any river system via TOML configuration
- **Multi-source intelligence**: Combine gauge data, weather forecasts, soil saturation, and dam operations
- **Historical learning**: Build flood prediction models from decades of archived data
- **Upstream lead time**: Detect flood conditions hours or days before they arrive downstream
- **Open architecture**: Extensible database schema for new data sources

**Reference Implementation:** Illinois River Basin (Peoria, IL) - 8 USGS monitoring stations with 87 years of historical data

- ⏸️ Additional data source ingestion (NWS forecasts, NOAA precipitation, soil moisture, USACE operations)

## Multi-Source Data Architecture

FloPro is designed to integrate multiple data sources for comprehensive flood prediction:

### Currently Implemented: USGS Stream Gauges

**Source:** U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System (NWIS)

| API | Coverage | Resolution | Use Case |
|-----|----------|------------|----------|
| **Instantaneous Values (IV)** | Last 120 days | 15 minutes | Real-time monitoring, recent flood detail |
| **Daily Values (DV)** | 1939-present | Daily means | Historical analysis, long-term trends, model training |

**Measurements:**
- Discharge (parameter 00060): Streamflow in cubic feet per second
- Gage height (parameter 00065): River stage in feet

**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented - API clients, database storage, historical backfill

### Planned: NWS Forecasts & Alerts

**Source:** National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS)

**Data Types:**
- Stage forecasts (predicted future river levels)
- Flood warnings and watches (CAP alerts)
- Official flood stage thresholds (action/minor/moderate/major)

**Use Case:** Authoritative government alerts, predicted future conditions

**Status:** 📋 Schema ready (nws.flood_warnings, nws.stage_forecasts), ingestion not implemented

### Planned: NOAA Precipitation

**Source:** NOAA Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) + National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD)

**Data Types:**
- Observed rainfall (radar-estimated, last 1/3/6/24/48 hours)
- Precipitation forecasts (predicted rainfall, 1-7 day outlook)

**Use Case:** Rainfall is the primary driver of river flooding - predict future discharge based on forecasted precipitation

**Status:** 📋 Schema designed (noaa.observed_precipitation, noaa.precipitation_forecasts), not implemented

### Planned: Soil Moisture

**Source:** USDA NRCS SNOTEL + NOAA Climate Prediction Center

**Data Types:**
- Point observations from field stations (volumetric water content by depth)
- Basin-averaged saturation index (composite metric 0-100)

**Use Case:** Saturated ground amplifies runoff from rainfall - high soil moisture increases flood risk

**Status:** 📋 Schema designed (soil.moisture_observations, soil.basin_saturation), not implemented

### Planned: USACE Lock & Dam Operations

**Source:** U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Lock Performance Monitoring System

**Data Types:**
- Current pool levels and release rates
- Scheduled water releases (maintenance/flood control)
- Operational status (normal, flood control mode, emergency)

**Use Case:** Dam releases can cause sudden discharge spikes - scheduled releases provide advance warning

**Status:** 📋 Schema designed (usace.lock_operations, usace.scheduled_releases), not implemented

- Documented flood history (1993, 2013, 2019)

**Monitoring Stations:** 8 USGS gauges configured in `stations.toml`
- Upstream early warning: Marseilles (80 mi, 36 hr), Chillicothe (10 mi, 9 hr)
- Primary monitoring: Kingston Mines (pool gauge), Peoria (discharge)
- Downstream verification: Havana (30 mi)
- Tributaries: Spoon River, Mackinaw River
- Water source: Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal

See [stations.toml](flomon_service/stations.toml) for complete configuration including flood thresholds, distances, and travel times.

## Configuration

### Station Configuration (stations.toml)

All station metadata, flood thresholds, and geographic relationships are defined in `stations.toml`:

```toml
[[station]]
site_code = "05568500"
name = "Illinois River at Kingston Mines, IL"
description = "Pool gauge for Peoria region (zero lag)"
latitude = 40.550556
longitude = -89.761111

distance_from_peoria_miles = 0
distance_direction = "upstream"
travel_time_to_peoria_hours = 0

expected_parameters = ["00060", "00065"]

[station.thresholds]
action_stage_ft = 15.0
flood_stage_ft = 18.0
moderate_flood_stage_ft = 21.0
major_flood_stage_ft = 23.0
```

**Station Reliability:** 6 of 8 configured stations operational (verified Feb 2026)
- 2 stations offline/decommissioned (Henry, Mackinaw Green Valley)
- System continues operating with degraded station set
- See [docs/STATION_RESILIENCE.md](flomon_service/docs/STATION_RESILIENCE.md)

### Database Schema

**Multi-schema architecture** for data source separation:

```
usgs_raw.*   -- USGS gauge readings and site metadata
nws.*        -- NWS flood thresholds, forecasts, alerts (planned)
noaa.*       -- Precipitation observations and forecasts (planned)
usace.*      -- Lock/dam operations and releases (planned)
soil.*       -- Soil moisture and saturation (planned)
```

**Current tables:**
- `usgs_raw.gauge_readings` - Time-series discharge and stage measurements
- `usgs_raw.sites` - Station metadata and coordinates
- `usgs_raw.monitoring_state` - Polling status and staleness tracking
- `nws.flood_thresholds` - Official NWS action/flood/moderate/major stages

**Planned tables:** See [docs/SCHEMA_EXTENSIBILITY.md](flomon_service/docs/SCHEMA_EXTENSIBILITY.md) for future data sources

### Upstream Early Warning

**Flood wave travel times** (Illinois River reference):

| Station | Distance | Travel Time | Use Case |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Marseilles | 80 mi upstream | 36 hours | Long-range warning |
| Starved Rock | 60 mi upstream | 24-48 hours | Medium-range forecast |
| Chillicothe | 10 mi upstream | 9 hours | Short-term alert |
| Kingston Mines | Pool gauge | 0 hours | Current conditions |

Times vary with flow velocity, precipitation, and USACE dam operations.

**Hybrid Database + In-Memory Cache:**
- Database (`monitoring_state` table): Source of truth, survives restarts
- In-memory cache: Fast staleness checks without database queries
- Refreshed on startup, updated each poll cycle
- See [sql/002_monitoring_metadata.sql](flomon_service/sql/002_monitoring_metadata.sql)

**Station Resilience:**
- Graceful degradation when stations go offline
- Per-parameter validation (discharge and stage tracked independently)
- Database constraints prevent duplicate readings (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`)
- System continues with partial station set

**Test-Driven Development:**
- Function stubs with failing tests for unimplemented features
- 17 TDD placeholders (staleness detection, data grouping, flood thresholds)
- Tests pass as functions are implemented

## Contributing

This project is in early development. The architecture is designed to be waterway-agnostic - contributions for new river systems, data sources, or prediction models are welcome.

**To adapt for your waterway:**
1. Create `stations.toml` with your USGS gauge stations
2. Configure flood thresholds (get from NWS AHPS for your area)
3. Set travel times and distances for upstream early warning
4. Run historical ingestion to populate database
5. (Future) Train prediction models on your historical flood events

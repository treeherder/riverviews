# TOML-Based CWMS Configuration Guide

## Overview

The flood monitoring system now loads USACE/CWMS locations from `usace_iem.toml` instead of hardcoding them in the database. This allows you to update timeseries IDs, add new locations, and adjust monitoring priorities without touching code or SQL.

## Key Features

### 1. Runtime Timeseries Discovery

The system **does not hardcode** CWMS timeseries IDs. Instead, at startup:

1. Loads location metadata from `usace_iem.toml`
2. Queries CWMS catalog API: `https://cwms-data.usace.army.mil/cwms-data/catalog/TIMESERIES`
3. Discovers actual available timeseries for each location
4. Uses discovered timeseries IDs for all subsequent polling

This solves the "version suffix varies by office" problem - the catalog returns the exact timeseries IDs that actually exist.

### 2. Configuration File Structure

```toml
[[usace_stations]]
shef_id         = "IL07"              # Legacy SHEF ID
cwms_location   = "Peoria-Pool"       # CWMS location name
office          = "MVR"               # USACE district office
name            = "Illinois River at Peoria Lock and Dam"
river_mile      = 157.6
pool_elevation_target_ft_ngvd29 = 447.0
data_types      = ["pool_elevation", "tailwater_elevation", "lockage"]
relevance       = "PRIMARY — directly controls Upper Peoria Lake level. ..."
flood_note      = "Wicket dam operation: when wickets are laid down..."
```

### 3. Monitoring Priorities (Auto-Detected)

The system determines polling frequency from the `relevance` text:

- **CRITICAL** (15-min polling): Contains "PRIMARY" or "CRITICAL"
- **HIGH** (60-min polling): Contains "HIGH" or "UPSTREAM WARNING"  
- **MEDIUM** (6-hour polling): Contains "EXTENDED" or "CONFLUENCE MONITOR"
- **LOW** (daily polling): Everything else

Change priority by editing the `relevance` field in the TOML.

## Startup Sequence

```
🌊 Flood Monitoring Service
============================

📊 Initializing daemon...
🔍 Discovering CWMS timeseries IDs from catalog...
   Illinois River at Peoria Lock and Dam ... 
      Discovered pool elevation: Peoria-Pool.Elev.Inst.~1Hour.0.CBT-RAW
      Discovered tailwater elevation: Peoria-TW.Elev.Inst.~1Hour.0.CBT-RAW
   ✓
   Illinois River at LaGrange Lock and Dam ... 
      Discovered pool elevation: LaGrange-Pool.Elev.Inst.~1Hour.0.CBT-RAW
      Discovered tailwater elevation: LaGrange-TW.Elev.Inst.~1Hour.0.CBT-RAW
   ✓
   Mississippi River at Grafton, IL ... 
      Discovered stage: Grafton.Stage.Inst.15Minutes.0.Ccp-Rev
   ✓
   
   Discovered timeseries for 13/13 locations

✓ Daemon initialized
```

## LaGrange Backwater Detection

The code includes special logic for detecting when the Mississippi River takes control:

```rust
// In src/ingest/cwms.rs
pub fn detect_hydraulic_control_loss(
    pool_elevation_ft: f64,
    tailwater_elevation_ft: f64,
    margin_ft: f64,
) -> bool {
    (tailwater_elevation_ft + margin_ft) >= pool_elevation_ft
}
```

When `LaGrange tailwater >= LaGrange pool - 0.5ft`:
- Dam has lost hydraulic control
- Mississippi backwater is dominant
- Peoria readings become lagging indicators
- Your property is flooding from "the bottom up"

## Catalog API Examples

### Query all Peoria timeseries
```bash
curl "https://cwms-data.usace.army.mil/cwms-data/catalog/TIMESERIES?office=MVR&like=Peoria.*&format=json"
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "entries": [
    {"name": "Peoria-Pool.Elev.Inst.~1Hour.0.CBT-RAW", "office": "MVR"},
    {"name": "Peoria-TW.Elev.Inst.~1Hour.0.CBT-RAW", "office": "MVR"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Query all LaGrange timeseries
```bash
curl "https://cwms-data.usace.army.mil/cwms-data/catalog/TIMESERIES?office=MVR&like=LaGrange.*&format=json"
```

### Query Mississippi River gauges (MVS district)
```bash
curl "https://cwms-data.usace.army.mil/cwms-data/catalog/TIMESERIES?office=MVS&like=Grafton.*&format=json"
```

## Adding a New Location

1. Add to `usace_iem.toml`:
```toml
[[usace_stations]]
shef_id         = "IL09"
cwms_location   = "Havana-Pool"
office          = "MVR"
name            = "Illinois River at Havana Lock and Dam"
river_mile      = 119.7
data_types      = ["pool_elevation", "tailwater_elevation"]
relevance       = "HIGH UPSTREAM WARNING — between LaGrange and Peoria"
```

2. Restart daemon - it will automatically:
   - Query catalog for "Havana.*" timeseries
   - Discover available data streams
   - Start polling based on priority (HIGH = 60 minutes)

3. No SQL or code changes needed!

## Handling Missing Timeseries

If catalog returns no timeseries for a location:

```
   Illinois River at Havana Lock and Dam ... ✗ No timeseries found
      Warning: Will skip polling for Illinois River at Havana Lock and Dam
```

The system continues operating with other locations. Fix by:

1. Verifying CWMS location name (check catalog manually)
2. Updating `cwms_location` in TOML  
3. Restarting daemon

## Data Type Mapping

The `data_types` field tells the discovery system what to look for:

- `"pool_elevation"` → Searches for `*-Pool.Elev.*`
- `"tailwater_elevation"` → Searches for `*-TW.Elev.*` or `*-Tailwater.Elev.*`
- `"stage"` → Searches for `*.Stage.*` (for river gauges, not pools)
- `"discharge"` → Searches for `*.Flow.*` or `*.Discharge.*`

## SHEF ID Notes

The TOML file includes SHEF IDs (IL02-IL08) which are the legacy identifiers from `rivergages.mvr.usace.army.mil`. These map directly to CWMS location names, though spelling may differ slightly:

- SHEF: `IL06` → CWMS: `Starved-Rock-Pool` (or `StarvedRock-Pool`)
- SHEF: `IL07` → CWMS: `Peoria-Pool`
- SHEF: `IL08` → CWMS: `LaGrange-Pool`

The catalog discovery handles these variations automatically.

## Extensibility

The same pattern applies to:

- **IEM ASOS stations** (already in TOML, code TODO)
- **NWS forecast points** (add `[[nws_stations]]` section)
- **USGS gauge supplements** (additional metadata beyond stations.toml)

All follow: **TOML → Runtime Discovery → Polling**

## Troubleshooting

### "No timeseries found for location: X"

1. Check catalog manually:
   ```bash
   curl "https://cwms-data.usace.army.mil/cwms-data/catalog/TIMESERIES?office=MVR&like=X.*&format=json" | jq
   ```

2. Verify `cwms_location` spelling matches catalog results

3. Check `data_types` includes what you expect (pool_elevation vs stage)

### "CWMS API error: 404 Not Found"

The discovered timeseries ID exists in catalog but returns 404 when queried:
- Timeseries may be configured but not receiving data
- Office ID may be wrong (MVR vs MVS)
- Historical data may not be available (check with shorter time range)

### "Failed to discover pool elevation"

Location might not have pool elevation timeseries (e.g., river gauges use "stage" instead):
- Change `data_types = ["pool_elevation"]` to `["stage"]`
- Or add both: `["pool_elevation", "stage"]` and system will find what's available

## Best Practices

1. **Don't hardcode timeseries IDs** - Let discovery handle it
2. **Check catalog before adding locations** - Verify data exists
3. **Use descriptive `relevance` text** - Determines priority automatically
4. **Document flood-specific behavior** in `flood_note` - Helps future debugging
5. **Test new locations with manual curl first** - Before adding to production config

## Implementation Files

- `src/usace_locations.rs` - TOML parsing and discovery logic
- `src/ingest/cwms.rs` - Catalog queries and backwater detection
- `src/daemon.rs` - Polling and backfill using discovered IDs
- `src/main.rs` - Startup discovery sequence
- `usace_iem.toml` - Configuration (user-editable)

## Next Steps

1. Verify discovered timeseries work (check first poll results)
2. Add remaining Illinois Waterway locks (IL03-IL06)
3. Add Mississippi River gauges (Alton, Hannibal)
4. Implement LaGrange backwater detection alerts
5. Add IEM ASOS precipitation monitoring

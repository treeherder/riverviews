# Geospatial Sensor Groups — Illinois River Basin Flood Monitor
#
# CONCEPT:
#   Each "zone" represents a geographic region of hydrological resolution.
#   A zone aggregates all sensors whose readings are physically meaningful
#   for understanding current and near-future conditions in that region.
#
#   Zones are ordered from your property outward in terms of spatial and
#   temporal proximity. The further the zone from Peoria, the longer the
#   lead time it represents.
#
#   Within each zone, sensors are labeled by their ROLE:
#     "direct"     — measures conditions at or within the zone itself
#     "boundary"   — measures what is entering or leaving the zone
#     "precip"     — measures rainfall over the zone's catchment
#     "proxy"      — not in the zone but strongly correlated to zone conditions

# Zone | Name                          | Lead Time    | Primary Alert Condition
# ─────┼───────────────────────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────
#  0   | Mississippi Backwater Source  | 12h–5 days   | Grafton stage > 20 ft
#  1   | Lower IL / Backwater Iface    | 6–24 hours   | LaGrange TW → pool diff < 1 ft
#  2   | Upper Peoria Lake (Property)  | NOW          | Peoria pool > 447.5 ft / Kingston Mines stage > 14 ft
#  3   | Local Tributaries             | 6–18 hours   | Mackinaw rate-of-rise > 1 ft/hr
#  4   | Mid IL River (Starved Rock)   | 18–48 hours  | Henry stage > 15 ft
#  5   | Upper IL River (Confluence)   | 36–72 hours  | Dresden pool elevated + Kankakee rising
#  6   | Chicago CAWS                  | 3–5 days     | O'Hare 6hr precip > 1.5 in + CSSC discharge spike
#
# BACKWATER EVENT signature: Zone 0 rising + Zone 1 TW/pool differential
#   collapsing + Peoria pool rising WITHOUT corresponding Zone 3/4/5 rise.
#
# UPSTREAM EVENT signature: Zone 5/6 elevated → Zone 4 rising → Zone 3
#   responding → Zone 2 cresting. Classic top-down flood progression.
#
# COMPOUND EVENT signature: Both mechanisms active simultaneously.
#   These are your worst-case events (2013, 2019, 2020 all had compound
#   characteristics). Treat any event where Zone 0 AND Zone 4+ are both
#   active as highest severity.
